NAME
  class propFile
SYNOPSIS
  propFile props -propertiesFile string -force boolean
DESCRIPTION
  package propFile provides support for Java style properties file in Tcl
  
  requires Itcl
  
  requires fileutil
  
  for a detailed specification of these types of files please see 
  http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/#Properties.htmlload(java.io.Reader)

  requires:
  - Tcl 8.3 or higher
  - package iTcl 3.0 or higher. most Tcl distributions include iTcl
  - package fileutil. this package is part of the tcllib libary available from
    <http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcllib/>. standard Windows Tcl distributions 
    include this library by default

  Version: 0.0.2
INPUT
  args:
  - propertiesFile type string mandatory
  - force type boolean optional default False
NOTES
  If the property keys contain escaped legal characters: "\ ", "\:", "\=" 
  then the actual content of the file must use a double escape instead of the
  simple escape. The format of the escape must be "\\ ", "\\:", "\\=". If this
  format is not respected, the property value pair will be split on the first 
  occurence of any of these sequences: " ", "\ ", "=", "\=", ":", "\:".

  If the properties file referenced by the propFile object exists, it will be
  tagged with the date and time and backed up during the object intialization
  with a date-time extension.

  Every time the properties file referenced by the propFile object changes
  during the life of the object, it will be backed up with an .orig extension
  before the change is applied.
